        <h2 class="title">Mountain</h2>
        <p>
          A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with
          steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. A mountain differs
          from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a
          hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the
          surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur
          in mountain ranges.
          <br /><br />
          Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism,
          which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. Once
          mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the
          action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass
          wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.
          <br /><br />
          High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level
          at similar latitude. These colder climates strongly affect the
          ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants
          and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate,
          mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource
          extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as
          mountain climbing and skiing.
